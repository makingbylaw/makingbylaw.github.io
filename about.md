Born in Hong Kong, Katy Law is a visual communicator. Her interest in visual communication began in her childhood, before the days of Graphical User Interfaces. Katy's pastimes ranged from shape and symmetry studies in her colorings to storytelling through the composition of paper collages. Her quest to rethink solutions to exisiting problems has led her to complete her Bachelor's Degree in Interaction Design at CCA. Today, she defines and creates systems and interfaces to delight humans.
